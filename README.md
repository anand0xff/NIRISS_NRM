# NIRISS_NRM

Creates NRM images and reconstructs them


Hi Anand,
 
I believe what you want is in my NIRISS_NRM github repo, the file is N1068_ob/test_segline_b1.fits. There are a few other models in that directory of various bin scalings, the code to produce those models is in the Code folder, “make_n1068_models.py”. I think it would be very helpful for you to create a fork of this repo if you have not already done so.
 
Let me know if you need anything else ☺
